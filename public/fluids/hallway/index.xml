      <description>if you take any system in the big ol&#39; universe, and add heat, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that the dynamics of that system will be governed by (i.e. can be described by) the equations of fluid mechanics.
 &amp;ldquo;when things get hot, everything looks the same.&amp;rdquo; the eqs of fluid mech also describe the event horizon of a black hole  (obviously) at the microscopic level fluids are flipping complicated. what we&amp;rsquo;re mostly interested in is: the PATTERNS that emerge in the COLLECTIVE behaviour of the large system of molecules/atoms/things.</description>

      <description>Â¶ fluids are macroscopic. two reasons:
 the macroscopic continuum approximation is valid. ie observable quantities of the fluid (flow velocity, density, etc) VARY SMOOTHLY in space and time, at macroscopic scales. this is because the mean free paths of the molecules in a fluid are SMALL compared to macroscopic length scales.    uh, how do we actually know this about the mean free path of molecules in a fluid?</description>
