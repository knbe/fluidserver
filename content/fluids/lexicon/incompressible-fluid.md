¶ if you assume density is constant, you're saying the fluid is incompressible 
  (pq to compress the fluid, you have to induce some kind of density variation)

¶ incompressible fluid: you're assuming variations of pressure are so small that 
  changes in density are negligible

¶ to be clear, this is an approximation. approximating constant ˝ρ˝ is only 
  valid when:
  - the velocities of the flow are much less than the speed of sound in the 
    fluid, then you don't have to worry about density variations

¶ incompressible fluids obey
