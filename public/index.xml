      <description>Barotropic fluid: a fluid where density is a function of pressure only (although a &amp;ldquo;perfect fluid&amp;rdquo; has a suspiciously similar definition&amp;hellip;) The key thing is, the relation between pressure and density is given by ˝w = P/ρ˝, where ˝w˝ is an equation of state parameter.
Define
 w&#39; = ÷{dw}{dͺln(a)} Insert ˝w = P₍X₎/ρ₍X₎˝ and use the product rule:
w&#39; &amp;amp;= ÷{d}{dͺln(a)} (P₍X₎⋄÷1{ρ₍X₎}) &amp;amp;= ÷{dͺP₍X₎}{dͺln(a)} ÷1{ρ₍X₎} + P₍X₎ ÷{dͺρ₍X₎⁽-1⁾}{dͺln(a)} &amp;amp;= ÷{dͺP₍X₎}{dͺρ₍X₎} ÷{dͺρ₍X₎}{dͺln(a)} ÷1{ρ₍X₎} - w ρ₍X₎ ÷1{ρ₍X₎⁽2⁾} ÷{dͺρ₍X₎}{dͺln(a)} (in the last step: use the chain rule to expand ˝d₍ln(a)₎P₍X₎˝, and likewise for ˝d₍ln(a)₎ρ₍X₎⁽-1⁾˝, and substitute ˝P₍X₎ = wρ₍X₎˝)</description>

      <description>what is the entropy of a fluid? what does it mean? &amp;laquo;
    ¶ bernoulli&amp;rsquo;s principle: comes from conservation of energy.
in a steady flow, the sum of all forms of energy is the same at all points (free of viscous forces). KE + PE + internal energy = constant.
means that an increase in speed of fluid occurs simultaneously with decrease in static pressure.</description>

      <description>in nature you find fluids that rotate nearly rigidly. this means fluids with a uniform distribution of vorticity.
 how can you have fluids that rotate regularly, and yet maintain a uniform velocity distribution?  it&amp;rsquo;s best to analyse these &amp;ldquo;rotating&amp;rdquo; fluids in a rotating reference frame, where the unperturbed fluid is at rest, and ALL perturbations are influenced by coriolis force(s) [WHYtf is this plural]. this results in &amp;ldquo;surprising&amp;rdquo; phenomena.</description>

      <description>when a fluid meets a solid surface, e.g. the edge of an airplane wing or a spoon stirring tea. ilya intermolecular forces that decelerate the fluid rapidly in a thin boundary layer along the surface. this deceleration gives rise to circulation and vorticity into the flow. the vorticity diffuses into the bulk flow, thickening the boundary layer.
I don&amp;rsquo;t understand p745. if the fluid is nonbarotropic due to spatially variable chemical composition or spatiallly variable T, then pressure gradients can also create vorticity, as described by the first term on the RHS of the vorticity evolution law, ˝-δivp × ¥divρ/ρ⁽2⁾˝.</description>

      <description>how long does it take for a bucket with a small hole in the side to empty?
you can start with the continuity equation:
 A₍1₎ v₍1₎ = A₍2₎ v₍2₎ the flux out:
 A₍2₎ √{2gh} convert to volumetric flux:
 V = A₍2₎v₍2₎t so time taken is:
 t = V / A₍2₎√{2gh}   [attach table of results]
not entirely sure this is correct. experimentally, I find it empties slower.</description>

      <description>for a n-dimensional space, the christoffel symbol is a n×n×n array of numbers that describes the curvature of a surface.
you calculate the christoffel symbol (that is, the components of the christoffel symbol) from the metric tensor of the surface/manifold. (the metric tensor is what defines the distance between points on the manifold).
the christoffel symbol defines the covariant derivative. this is a special derivative for a curved surface that accounts for the curvature of the surface.</description>

      <description>the density Ω is the ratio of the actual observed density ρ to the critical density ρ₍c₎ of a friedmann universe. the ratio determines the overall geometry of the universe. when they&amp;rsquo;re equal, flat.
in earlier models that didn&amp;rsquo;t have a cosmological constant, critical density was defined as the watershed point between an expanding and contracting universe.
ρ₍c₎ is estimated to be 5 atoms of monatomic hydrogen per cubic metre today.</description>

      <description>RECAP: ANOMALOUS DIMENSIONS  ¶ when anomalous dimensions arise, it means there&amp;rsquo;s a microscopic length at work.
 this microscopic length scale affects the thermo functions and the correlation function asymptotically near the critical point mmly this means you can&amp;rsquo;t approximate a function ˝f(x)˝ with ˝f(x = 0)˝ when ˝x → 0˝. that kind of limit approximation is not valid.  ¶ so basically, whenever there&amp;rsquo;s a function ˝f(x)˝ that you can&amp;rsquo;t replace with ˝f(0)˝ when ˝x˝ is small, it means there&amp;rsquo;s an anomalous dimension.</description>

      <description>INTRO  ¶ you can&amp;rsquo;t always get similarity solutions using dimensional analysis, because ADs can occur.
¶ goal:
 show an example of this (how you can&amp;rsquo;t always get SSs using DA) by looking at the LT bhvr of a slight modification to the diffusion equation will show that a naive application of DA fails to get the correct LT bhvr, BUT a modded similarity solution with an AD does get the correct LT bhvr  ¶ order:</description>

¶ or: a fluid that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have viscosity or shear stresses.
¶ you can decompose the stress tensor into:
 an isotropic pressure term a viscous term linear in the rate of shear (velocity gradient)  if the viscous stress is negligible (in many cases it is) and heat conductivity is negligible, then the fluid is ideal.</description>

      <description>A cosmological cube:
 The contrast in the image shows (somewhat) the local variations in the (over)density field. The power spectrum is essentially a measure of the density contrast in space.
Some theory: the fractional overdensity ˝δ(⬀x)˝ describes the deviation of the density field, ˝ρ(⬀x)˝, from the average density, ˝⟨ρ⟩˝
 δ(⬀x) = ÷{ ρ(⬀x) - ⟨ρ⟩ }{ ⟨ρ⟩ } where ˝ρ(⬀x)˝ is the density at point ˝⬀x˝ and ˝⟨ρ⟩˝ is the average density over (all) space.</description>

¶ defined as force per unit area.
¶ compressive stress: is when forces (like tension or compression) cause an object to become compressed.

 any time you apply a shear to a fluid, the fluid will move. fluids that more more easily are less viscous, and v.v.  ¶ think about the fluid as a series of parallel plates. if there is a shear force, the plates move at different rates.
