¶ physically: viscosity is a measure of how easily a fluid yields to a shear 
  stress.
  - any time you apply a shear to a fluid, the fluid will move. fluids that more 
    more easily are less viscous, and v.v.

¶ think about the fluid as a series of parallel plates. if there is a shear 
  force, the plates move at different rates.

¶ pick two plates, let d be the distance between them, and let ˝v₍0₎˝ be the 
  speed of the slower one. the shear stress is
  ```
    ÷FA = η ÷{v₍0₎}d
  ```
  where ˝η˝ is the coefficient of viscosity.
