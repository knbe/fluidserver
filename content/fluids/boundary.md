in nature you find fluids that rotate nearly rigidly. this means fluids with a 
uniform distribution of vorticity. 
  - how can you have fluids that rotate regularly, and yet maintain a uniform 
    velocity distribution?

it's best to analyse these "rotating" fluids in a rotating reference frame, 
where the unperturbed fluid is at rest, and ALL perturbations are influenced by 
coriolis force(s) [WHYtf is this plural]. this results in "surprising" 
phenomena. in this section, we explore some of these phenomena.

foundation: we transform the NS equation from the inertial frame (the frame that 
we derived it in) to a UNIFORMLY ROTATING FRAME: the mean frame of the flows we 
study. 

note that the NS eq has the same form as newton's 2nd law for particle motion: 
big fucking deal?? why? isn't this confirmation bias?

force per unit mass:
```
  ⬀f = -∇p / ρ - ∇φ + ν ∇⁽2⁾v
```
