¶ __shear stress:__ the component of stress that's coplanar from the material's 
  cross section. denoted ˝τ˝:
  ```
    τ = F/A
  ```
  - ˝F˝ is the force applied, ˝A˝ is the crosssectional area of the material 
    whose area is parallel to the applied force vector

¶ "ordinary" stress comes from the force vector component perpendicular to the 
  material cross section.
