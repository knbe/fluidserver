title: "reynolds number"
type: long

¶ is basically a metric for quantifying/comparing viscosities. you ompare the 
  {{< ℑ viscosity >}} ˝ν˝ with the product of the flow's characteristic velocity 
  ˝V˝ and its characteristic length scale ˝L˝.
  ```
    Re = ÷{LV}{ν}
  ```
  - this is the **reynolds number**
  - it's dimensionless
  - flows with ˝Re < 1˝ are dominated by viscosity
  - flows with ˝Re > 1˝ can be _influenced_ by viscosity, especially when it 
    acts near boundaries, BUT the viscous stresses are negligible over most of 
    the flow's volume
