if you take any system in the big ol' universe, and add heat, you'll find that 
the dynamics of that system will be governed by (i.e. can be described by) the 
equations of fluid mechanics. 
  - "when things get hot, everything looks the same."
  - the eqs of fluid mech also describe the event horizon of a black hole

(obviously) at the microscopic level fluids are flipping complicated. what we're 
mostly interested in is: the PATTERNS that emerge in the COLLECTIVE behaviour of 
the large system of molecules/atoms/things. 

the "long-lived" (large timescale) modes of a fluid all relate nicely to the 
usual conservation laws - mass, energy, momentum.
  - this is pretty much why all fluids look the same.
  - the eqs of fluid mech are eqs that describe the time evolution of conserved 
    variables/observables.

all fluid motion boils down to a basic set of equations:
  - navier stokes
  - something that describes the conservation of mass
  - something that describes the flow of heat
