¶ strain is a measure of deformation of an object. it describes the displacement 
  between particles relative to a reference length

¶ functional form of deformation:
  ```
    ↗x = F(↗x')
  ```
  - ↗x' is an array of reference positions for points of the body
  - deformations have units of length

¶ strains are usually dimensionless

¶ whenever a solid material undergoas a strain (deformation), there is an 
  internal elastic stress that causes the object to restore to its original 
  non-deformed state (like the spring force)

¶ in liquids and gases, ONLY deformations that change the volume will generate a 
  persistent elastic stress
  - if the deformation changes gradually, in fluids there will be some viscous 
    stress that opposes the change.

¶ elastic and viscous stresses are both kinds of mechanical stress.
