      <description>¶ archimedes&amp;rsquo; law: when a solid is immersed (fully or partially) in a fluid, and there&amp;rsquo;s a uniform gravitational field ˝↗g = -g↗e₍z₎˝, the total upwards force of the fluid on the body (&amp;ldquo;buoyant force&amp;rdquo;) equals the weight of displaced fluid.</description>

      <description>BARENBLATT&amp;rsquo;S EQUATION ¶ recall, the modified porous medium equation
££ \begin{equation} 𝝏{t}{u(r,t)} = D·Δ₍d₎·u(r,t)⁽1&amp;#43;n⁾ \end{equation} ££ the case ˝n = 0˝ is the barenblatt equation. this is a fluid that can expand and contract irreversibly in response to a fluid flow through it.
?? what does it mean, to expand and contract irreversibly? DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF BARENBLATT&amp;rsquo;S EQUATION ¶ barenblatt&amp;rsquo;s equation in 1d:
££ \begin{equation} 𝝏{t}{u(x,t)} = Dκ·𝝏n{2}{x}{u(x,t)} \end{equation} ££ where ££ \begin{equation} D == ÷12 𝝏{t}{u} &amp;gt; 0 == ÷{1&amp;#43;ε}{2} 𝝏{t}{u} &amp;lt; 0 \end{equation} ££ ˝κ˝ and ˝ε˝ are constants.</description>

      <description>what is the entropy of a fluid? what does it mean? &amp;laquo;
¶ bernoulli&amp;rsquo;s principle: comes from conservation of energy.
in a steady flow, the sum of all forms of energy is the same at all points (free of viscous forces). KE + PE + internal energy = constant.
means that an increase in speed of fluid occurs simultaneously with decrease in static pressure.
¶ can derive bernoulli&amp;rsquo;s principle from euler&amp;rsquo;s equation (restatement of newton&amp;rsquo;s second law).</description>

      <description>conservation of mass, eulerian ¶ in the eulerian approach to mass conservation, you monitor the change in density at a given point in space, rather than moving with the flow [thorne p692].
¶ when dealing with continua, all conservation of mass laws tend to have the form ˝𝝏₍t₎˝(density of something) = ˝∇⦁˝(flux of that thing). ie, rate of change of density wrt time = rate of change of flux wrt space</description>

      <description>¶ consider a small area element, d↗A. momentum flows through this area in the +ve direction. the MASS FLOW RATE thru the surface is
££ \begin{equation} ρ↗v ⦁ d↗A = dot(momentumͺdensity, vectorͺareaͺelement) \end{equation} ££ multiply by velocity to get the MOMENTUM FLOW RATE:
££ \begin{equation} ḍ₍t₎⬀p = (ρ⬀v)·(⬀v⦁d⬀A) \end{equation} ££ this is just the force ˝⬀F = ḍ⬀p˝ across the area element ˝d↗A˝. from the definition of the stress tensor, you can compute the force by inserting ˝d↗A˝ into the 2nd arg of a stress tensor,</description>

      <description>RECAP: ANOMALOUS DIMENSIONS ¶ when anomalous dimensions arise, it means there&amp;rsquo;s a microscopic length at work.
this microscopic length scale affects the thermo functions and the correlation function asymptotically near the critical point mmly this means you can&amp;rsquo;t approximate a function ˝f(x)˝ with ˝f(x = 0)˝ when ˝x → 0˝. that kind of limit approximation is not valid. ¶ so basically, whenever there&amp;rsquo;s a function ˝f(x)˝ that you can&amp;rsquo;t replace with ˝f(0)˝ when ˝x˝ is small, it means there&amp;rsquo;s an anomalous dimension.</description>

      <description>¶ take the momentum conservation law for a fluid,
££ \begin{equation} 𝝏₍t₎(ρ↗v) &amp;#43; ∇⦁T = ρ↗g \end{equation} ££ differentiate then invoke the mass conservation law,
££ \begin{equation} 𝝏₍t₎ρ &amp;#43; ∇⦁(ρ↗v) = 0 \end{equation} ££ you get the euler equation:
££ \begin{equation} Ɗ₍t₎↗v = 𝝏₍t₎↗v &amp;#43; (↗v⦁∇)↗v = -÷1ρ·∇p &amp;#43; ↗g \end{equation} ££ ¶ the LHS is the advective derivative of ↗v, ie the acceleration of the fluid. from the RHS, you can see there are two terms that cause the acceleration: gravity, and the pressure gradient.</description>

      <description>HYDRODYNAMICS ¶ hydrodynamics is when the fluid velocity ˝↗v(↗x,t)˝ is nonzero (as opposed to hydrostatics).
CONSERVATION conservation of mass, eulerian ¶ in the eulerian approach to mass conservation, you monitor the change in density at a given point in space, rather than moving with the flow [thorne p692].
¶ when dealing with continua, all conservation of mass laws tend to have the form ˝𝝏₍t₎˝(density of something) = ˝∇⦁˝(flux of that thing).</description>

      <description>STRESS, σ ¶ is a quantity that describes the forces in an object that cause deformation (strain). describes the internal forces that neighbouring particles exert on each other, in a continuous material.
¶ defined as force per unit area.
¶ compressive stress: is when forces (like tension or compression) cause an object to become compressed.
the bigger these forces and the smaller the cross sectional area, the greater the stress. is why stress is defined as force per unit area ¶ dimensions: ˝[σ] = L⁽-1⁾ M T⁽-2⁾˝</description>

      <description>¶ you can decompose the stress tensor into:
an isotropic pressure term a viscous term linear in the rate of shear (velocity gradient) if the viscous stress is negligible (in many cases it is) and diffusive heatconductivity is negligible, the fluid is ideal. </description>

      <description>¶ define [INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW] : a flow where the density is constant in a parcel of fluid. incompressible flows obey:
££ \begin{equation} ∇⦁↗v = 0 \end{equation} ££ ˝↗v˝ is the flow velocity (a vector field since it&amp;rsquo;s a flow).
note this equation has the same form as the equation for a solenoidal field. indeed, for incompressible flows the velocity field is solenoidal.
¶ when can you assume the fluid density is constant?</description>

      <description>INTRO ¶ you can&amp;rsquo;t always get similarity solutions using dimensional analysis, because ADs can occur.
¶ goal:
show an example of this (how you can&amp;rsquo;t always get SSs using DA) by looking at the LT bhvr of a slight modification to the diffusion equation will show that a naive application of DA fails to get the correct LT bhvr, BUT a modded similarity solution with an AD does get the correct LT bhvr ¶ order:</description>

££ \begin{equation} ∇⦁↗v = 0 ρ·𝝏{t}{↗v} = -∇p &amp;#43; μ∇⁽2⁾↗v &amp;#43; ρF \end{equation} ££ ¶ the conservation of mass equation
££ \begin{equation} ∇⦁↗v = 0 \end{equation} ££ aka the incompressibility equation expanded: ££ \begin{equation} (𝝏{x}{}↑x &amp;#43; 𝝏{y}{}↑y &amp;#43; 𝝏{z}{}↑z)⦁(v₍x₎↑x &amp;#43; v₍y₎↑y &amp;#43; v₍z₎↑z) = 0 𝝏{x}{v₍x₎} &amp;#43; 𝝏{y}{v₍y₎} &amp;#43; 𝝏{z}{v₍z₎} = 0 \end{equation} ££ all this equation says is, mass is conserved ¶ newton&amp;rsquo;s 2nd law, mass × acceleration = force</description>

      <description>¶ kinematic viscosity ˝ν˝ has dimensions ˝length⁽2⁾/time˝. to quantiy viscosity in fluid flow, you compare ˝ν˝ with the product of the flow&amp;rsquo;s characteristic velocity ˝V˝ and its characteristic length scale ˝L˝.
££ \begin{equation} Re = ÷{LV}{ν} \end{equation} ££ this is the reynolds number it&amp;rsquo;s dimensionless flows with ˝Re &amp;lt; 1˝ are dominated by viscosity flows with ˝Re &amp;gt; 1˝ can be influenced by viscosity, especially when it acts near boundaries, BUT the viscous stresses are negligible over most of the flow&amp;rsquo;s volume </description>

      <description>¶ shear stress: the component of stress that&amp;rsquo;s coplanar from the material&amp;rsquo;s cross section. denoted ˝τ˝:
££ \begin{equation} τ = F/A \end{equation} ££ ˝F˝ is the force applied, ˝A˝ is the crosssectional area of the material whose area is parallel to the applied force vector ¶ &amp;ldquo;ordinary&amp;rdquo; stress comes from the force vector component perpendicular to the material cross section.</description>

      <description>GOAL: describe the internal forces in a material/body in terms of a tensor.
STRESSES &amp;amp; INTERNAL FORCES ¶ the STRESSES in a material are the various internal forces that maintain its form.
suppose you dissect a 3d object with a plane. take a small area element of the plane. the material on the left of the area element will exert a force ΔF to the right, and v.v.

      <description>FLUID MOTION RECAP ¶ the laws of motion for a fluid are contained in the equation
££ \begin{equation} 𝝏{t}{↗v} &amp;#43; (↗v⦁∇)↗v = -÷1ρ·∇p - ∇φ &amp;#43; ÷1ρ·↗f₍visc₎ \end{equation} ££ ¶ in the dry water approximation you leave out the last term, ie neglect viscous effects
¶ another (additional) approximation is assuming the fluid is incompressible, so
££ \begin{equation} ∇⦁↗v = 0 \end{equation} ££ ¶ the incompressible approximation is good when flow speeds are much slower than the speed of sound.</description>

      <description>¶ fluids are macroscopic. two reasons:
the macroscopic continuum approximation is valid. ie observable quantities of the fluid (flow velocity, density, etc) VARY SMOOTHLY in space and time, at macroscopic scales. this is because the mean free paths of the molecules in a fluid are SMALL compared to macroscopic length scales. uh, how do we actually know this about the mean free path of molecules in a fluid? &amp;laquo;
this is actually what allows you to define a mean local velocity ˝↗v(↗x,t)˝.</description>
