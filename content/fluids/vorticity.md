# VORTICITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

¶ define vorticity, ˝↗Ω˝, the curl of the velocity field ˝↗v˝
  ```
    ↗Ω = ∇×↗v
  ```
  - this is also a vector field

¶ what vorticity actually is:
  - take a small fluid element. 
  - consider how this fluid element moves over a short period of time ˝dt˝
  - each "bit" of fluid in the fluid element has a small displacement in this 
    interval. let the displacement of this bit be ˝↗ε = ↗vdt˝
  - the gradient of the displacement ˝↗ε˝ will be comprised of an expansion, 
    rotation, and shear.
  - the "vectorial" angle of rotation is ˝↗φ = ÷12·∇×↗ε˝
  - the time derivative of the vectorial angle of rotation is 
    ```
      Ɗ₍t₎↗φ = ÷12·Ɗ₍t₎↗ε = ÷12·∇×↗v
    ```
  - this is just the fluid element's rotational angular velocity
  - thus, the vortivity is just twice the angular velocity of rotation of a 
    fluid element.

¶ the equation of motion becomes
  ```
    𝝏{t}{↗v} + ↗Ω×↗v + ÷12 ∇v⁽2⁾ = -÷1ρ ∇p - ∇φ
  ```

¶ if vorticity is zero everywhere, the flow is __irrotational__
  - recall: the circulation of a vector field around any closed loop
  - the circulation around a closed loop in a fluid is the line integral of the 
    fluid velocity at a particular instant of time around that loop
  ```
    (circulation) = ∮ ↗v⦁d↗s
  ```
