# RECAP: LAMINAR PIPE FLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

¶ the flow velocity profile is parabolic (across the cylindrical cross section). 
  you can achieve this form by balancing the stress across the surface. 

¶ the rate of flow is proportional to the 4th power of pipe diameter:
```
  flowͺrateͺ(volumetricͺflux) ∝ d⁽4⁾
```

¶ reynolds number:
```
  Re₍pipe₎ = ÷1ν ⟨v⟩d
```

¶ experimentally pipe flow is only laminar up to a critical Re number, 
  ˝∼10⁽3⁾-10⁽5⁾˝.  the exact value depends on smoothness of the walls and the 
  pipe entrance.


¶ turbulence: if you increase the Re number the critical number (e.g. by 
  increasing the pressure gradient, thereby increasing ⟨v⟩, then the velocity 
  field becomes irregular, spatially and temporally. you get turbulence.
