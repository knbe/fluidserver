{{< 𝖉𝖊𝖋 SHEAR FORCES >}}
  forces that acts on one part of a body in a certain direction, and another 
  part in the opposite direction
{{< /𝖉𝖊𝖋 >}}

¶ if the forces are aligned (collinear), then they are just tension or 
  compression forces

{{< 𝖉𝖊𝖋 SHEAR STRESS τ >}}
  the component of stress that's coplanar with the body's cross section
  ```
    τ = ÷FA
  ```
  - ˝A˝ is the cross sectional area of the material that's parallel to the 
    applied force
  - points are coplanar if there's a plane that contains them all

¶ "ordinary" stress comes from the force vector component perpendicular to the 
  material cross section.
