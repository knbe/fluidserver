¶ is a quantity that describes the forces in an object that cause deformation 
  (strain). describes the internal forces that neighbouring particles exert on 
  each other, in a continuous material.

¶ defined as force per unit area.

¶ compressive stress: is when forces (like tension or compression) cause an 
  object to become compressed.
  - the bigger these forces and the smaller the cross sectional area, the 
    greater the stress.
  - is why stress is defined as force per unit area

¶ dimensions: ˝[σ] = L⁽-1⁾ M T⁽-2⁾˝

¶ SI unit: pascal
  - base units: ˝Pa = kg m⁽-1⁾ s⁽-2⁾˝

¶ [examples][1] of mechanical stress:
  - tension
  - compression
  - shear
  - bending
  - torsion
