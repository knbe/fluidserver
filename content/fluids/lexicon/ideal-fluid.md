¶ a fluid that you can describe using only the density ρ and pressure p.

¶ or: a fluid that doesn't have viscosity or shear stresses.

¶ you can decompose the stress tensor into:
  - an isotropic pressure term
  - a viscous term linear in the rate of shear (velocity gradient)

if the viscous stress is negligible (in many cases it is) and heat conductivity 
is negligible, then the fluid is ideal.
